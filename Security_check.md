🔒 Security Expert Recommendation:
YES! Use "Sign in with Google" (OAuth2) ✅✅✅
This is actually THE BEST choice for your school library! Here's why:

✅ Why Google Sign-In is BETTER:
1. Security Benefits:
✅ No password storage - Google handles it (they're experts!)
✅ No password breaches - You can't leak what you don't have
✅ Two-factor authentication - Automatic (if students enable it)
✅ Password reset - Not your problem anymore!
✅ Account recovery - Google handles it
✅ No "forgot password" emails - One less thing to build
2. User Experience Benefits:
✅ One-click login - No typing passwords
✅ Automatic email verification - Google already verified it
✅ Students already have Google accounts - School emails!
✅ No "create password" friction - Easier signup
✅ Works across devices - Same account everywhere
3. Development Benefits:
✅ Less code to write - Google does the heavy lifting
✅ No password reset flow - Saves you days of work
✅ No email verification - Already verified by Google
✅ Compliant with best practices - Google handles regulations
✅ Free! - No cost for Google OAuth
4. For Schools:
✅ Google Workspace integration - Perfect for schools!
✅ School email verification - Automatic (@yourschool.edu)
✅ Admin can manage access - Through Google Workspace
✅ Professional - Students trust Google
❌ Why Traditional Passwords are RISKY for you:
Problems with Storing Passwords:
❌ Security responsibility - You're liable if breached
❌ Compliance requirements - GDPR, data protection laws
❌ Hashing complexity - Need to do it perfectly
❌ Password reset emails - Need email server setup
❌ Weak passwords - Users will pick "password123"
❌ Forgotten passwords - Constant support requests
❌ Session management - More complex security
🎯 My Expert Recommendation:
Use Google Sign-In ONLY (OAuth2)
Here's the plan:

Remove the password field from your signup
Add "Sign in with Google" button
Verify email domain (only @yourschool.edu)
Auto-create accounts on first Google login
Benefits for Option 1 (Quick Beta):

⚡ Faster to implement than password reset system
🔒 More secure than managing passwords yourself
😊 Better UX - Students love one-click login
💰 Free - No email server costs
📊 Industry Best Practice:
Most modern apps use OAuth (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.) because:

Security: Let the experts handle authentication
Convenience: Users prefer it
Cost: Free vs. paid email services
Trust: Users trust Google more than unknown sites
Examples:

Slack: Google Sign-In
Notion: Google Sign-In
Figma: Google Sign-In
Discord: OAuth options
GitHub: OAuth standard
Your school library should do the same! ✅

🚀 Implementation Plan:
What We'll Build:
"Sign in with Google" button on login page
Verify school email domain (@yourschool.edu only)
Auto-create user account on first login
Keep existing features (admin dashboard, etc.)
Remove password fields (safer!)
What We DON'T Need:
❌ Password fields
❌ "Forgot password" flow
❌ Email verification system
❌ Password reset emails
❌ Password strength validation
Result: Simpler, safer, faster! 🎉

💡 For Your School:
Perfect Match Because:
Students already have @yourschool.edu emails
School uses Google Workspace (probably)
IT department already manages Google accounts
Students are familiar with Google login
Parents trust Google security
Admin Control:
School IT can disable accounts through Google
No need to manage passwords in your system
Automatic email updates from Google
Compliance with school IT policies
🎯 My Final Advice:
DO THIS: Sign in with Google Only ✅

DON'T DO: Store passwords yourself ❌

You're absolutely right to be concerned about password storage!

As a security expert, I can tell you:

80% of breaches involve stolen credentials
Password management is complex and risky
OAuth2 is the gold standard for modern apps
Google's security team is better than any solo developer
⚡ Ready to Implement?
Want me to:

Add Google Sign-In button to your login page?
Set up OAuth2 authentication with Django?
Verify school email domains (@yourschool.edu)?
Remove password fields for cleaner security?
This will take about 2-3 hours to implement properly, and you'll have a much more secure system!

Should I start? Let me know and I'll build it! 🚀
